###### This repository is for DataMining(DM) cource in university of Amirkabir under supervision of Dr.Ehsan Nazerfard

# [Home Work 1](https://github.com/kasrakhalafi/DataMining/tree/master/HW1) 
In HW1, Firstly some basic definition was asked, then Aprioriti, FP-growth, K-Means and associate rules were calculated for writing part.
In implementation, main idea was using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries for 'COVID-19' data set in South Korea.

# [Home Work 2](https://github.com/kasrakhalafi/DataMining/tree/master/HW2) 
In first part, K-Means algorithm was used for compressing a picture. Then with elbow method, number of clusters (K) was choosen.
In second part of implementation, DBSCAN method was used to cluster 'COVID-19' patients on map using Folium library.
